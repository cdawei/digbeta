% - playlist generation
{\it Some related work.}

In this paper, we describe two variants of the playlist recommendation problem,
one is augmenting a playlist by recommending a subset of songs from a collection of music $\SCal$,
given the first $K$ seed songs, where $K$ can be any positive integer from 1 to the total number of songs in playlist minus 1.
% in contrast to settings where all songs except the last one are observed\cite{}, or giving a fixed number of seed songs\cite{}.
Another variant is restricting that all songs to recommend are not observed during learning,
\ie in the setting of recommending newly released songs to augment a given playlist, which is an instance of the cold-start problem.
We call the first variant \emph{playlist augmentation} and the second \emph{new song recommendation}.
