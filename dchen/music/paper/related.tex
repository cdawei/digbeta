We summarise recent work most related to recommending music for playlist
according the problem settings, the recommendation method,
as well as the information being utilised.


{\bf Problem settings} for music recommendation including three typical settings:
playlist generation, next song recommendation, and playlist continuation.
%
There is rich collection of recent literature on the playlist generation 
or prediction~\cite{platt2002learning,mcfee2011natural,mcfee2012hypergraph,chen2012playlist,ben2017groove} 
%
Typically work is to generate a complete playlist given some seed,
for example, the AutoDJ system~\cite{platt2002learning} generate playlists given one or more seed songs,
a playlist for a specific user can be generated by Groove Radio given a seed artist~\cite{ben2017groove},
or a seed location in hidden space, which all songs are embedded, 
should to be specified to generate a complete playlist~\cite{chen2012playlist}.
%
There are also work that focus on evaluating the learned playlist model, 
without concretely generate playlist~\cite{mcfee2011natural,mcfee2012hypergraph}.
More details of playlist generation can be found in this recent survey~\cite{bonnin2015automated}.


Next song recommendation~\cite{hariri2012context,bonnin2013evaluating,jannach2015beyond}
is to predict the next song a user might play after observing some context,
for example, the most recent sequence of songs a user interacted with the system was used to 
infer the contextual information, which was further used to rank the next possible song 
with regards to a topic-based sequential patterns learned from user playlists~\cite{hariri2012context}.
%
The artists appeared in user's listening history can be used as context, 
which, together with the popularity of song or frequency of artists collocations,
were further used to score the next song~\cite{mcfee2012million,bonnin2013evaluating}.
%
It is obvious that next song recommendation techniques can also be used to generate a 
complete playlist by picking the next song sequentially~\cite{bonnin2013evaluating,ben2017groove}.


Playlist continuation is to add one or more songs to a playlist,
