% Problems description
% - playlist augmentation
% - new song recommendation
% - related work: the same, the different

% 2. Playlist augmentation and bipartite ranking
% Method:
% - augment one playlist can be achieved by bipartite ranking (assume order of tracks is irrelevant)
% - known: bipartite ranking == binary classification (under assumptions)
% - Theorem 1
% 
% 3. Playlist augmentation and multi-label classification
% Method:
% - augment multiple playlists -> multiple bipartite ranking -> multi-label classification
% - Theorem 2
% - one user has multiple playlists -> multi-task regularisation
%
% 4. New song recommendation: an extension of playlist augmentation
% Method:
% - the same as previous work (cold start)
% - the different (?)
%
% 5. Experiment
% - multi-label classification
% - playlist augmentation
