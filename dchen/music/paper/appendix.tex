It is believed that
useful recommendations need to include previously unknown items~\cite{herlocker2004evaluating,zhang2012auralist}.
%and this 
This ability can be measured by \emph{Novelty},
$$
\text{Novelty@K} = \frac{1}{U} \sum_{u=1}^U \frac{1}{|P_u|} \sum_{m \in S_K} \frac{-\log_2 pop_m}{K},
$$
where $S_K$ is the set of top-$K$ recommendations and $pop_m$ is the popularity of song $m$.
Intuitively, the more popular a song is, 
%an average user 
a user is more likely to be familiar with it,
therefore less novel. %to the user.
%
%On the other hand,
\emph{Spread}, however, is used to measure the ability of an algorithm to spread its attention across all possible songs.
It is defined as the entropy of the distribution of all songs, %possible songs to recommend,
$$
\text{Spread} = -\sum_{m=1}^M P(m) \log P(m),
$$
where $P(m)$ denotes the probability of song $m$ being recommended,
which is computed from the scores of all possible songs using the softmax function.
