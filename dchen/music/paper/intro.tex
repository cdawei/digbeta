%help user explore large collection of music

% brief description of both recommendation tasks
We are motivated by the problem of automatically augmenting music playlist with a collection of songs $\SCal$,
in particular, given a partial playlist with the first $K$ songs\footnote{$K$ can be different for different partial playlists.},
we would like to recommend a subset of $\SCal$ by learning from user created playlist dataset.
This task is also known as Automatic Playlist Continuation~\cite{schedl2017,recsysch2018}.
