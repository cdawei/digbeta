\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Online music streaming services (e.g., Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music) % Google Play Music, Amazon Music) 
play an increasingly important role in the digital music industry.
A key ingredient of these services is the ability to automatically recommend songs to help users explore large collections of music.
%as well as create an uninterrupted listening experience.
Such recommendation is often in the form of a \emph{playlist}, 
%which is simply an ordered sequence of songs
which involves a (small) set of songs.
%
% one paragraph about recommender system
Conventional recommender systems for books or movies~\citep{Sarwar:2001,Netflix}
typically learn a score function via matrix factorisation~\citep{Koren:2009},
and recommend the item that achieves the highest score.
This approach is not suited to %deal with 
\emph{cold-start} settings,
where there is no historical data for either users or items.
%
% explain what is different about recommending playlist
Further, in playlist recommendation,
one has to recommend a subset of a large collection of songs instead of only one top ranked song.
Enumerating all possible such subsets is intractable;
additionally,
it is likely that more than one playlist is satisfactory, since
users generally maintain more than one playlist when using a music streaming service,
which leads to challenges in standard supervised learning.


%We investigate the problem of recommending a playlist of songs for a given user.
%If the user is new to the system, we would like to make a decent default recommendation by learning from 
%all available playlists of existing users.
%On the other hand, if the user already has a few playlists in the system, it is expected the recommender 
%system can also learn from this information and hopefully make better recommendations.
%
We investigate the problem of recommending songs to form personalised playlists %(for a given user)
in cold-start settings by learning from user-curated playlists.
%
%First, we study the problem of recommending a set of songs to form a playlist for a new user (\ie \emph{cold user}).
%We find it is challenging to improve recommendations beyond simply ranking songs according to their popularity,
%which is consistent with discoveries in~\cite{mcfee2012million,bonnin2013evaluating,bonnin2015automated}.
% the reason is believed to be that a small number of popular songs appeared in a large number of playlists, 
% and the majority of songs only appear in a few playlists~\cite{bonnin2013evaluating}.
% This is consistent with discoveries in~\cite{bonnin2013evaluating,jannach2015beyond,bonnin2015automated}
%
First, we study the problem of recommending a set of songs to form a new playlist for a user
%We learn the preference of the given user from her existing playlists,
by exploiting the (implicit) preference %of the given user 
from her existing playlists.
We find that learning from a user's existing playlists %can significantly 
improves the accuracy of recommendation.
Since we do not have any contextual information about the new playlist, 
we call this setting \emph{cold playlists}.
%
We further consider the setting of new users (\ie \emph{cold users}),
where we recommend playlists for new users.
We find it challenging to improve recommendations beyond simply ranking songs according to their popularity 
if we know nothing about the user, which is consistent with previous 
discoveries~\cite{mcfee2012million,bonnin2013evaluating,bonnin2015automated}.
However, improvement can still be achieved if we know a few simple attributes (\eg age, gender, country etc.)
of the users.
%
%This motivates us to exploit the (implicit) user preference from her existing playlists,
%which leads to the \emph{cold playlists} setting,
%where a set of songs are recommended to form a new playlist for an existing user. %of a music service.
%We find that learning from a user's existing playlists %can significantly 
%improves the accuracy of recommendation.
%
%In addition, 
%We further investigate the value of seed songs for improving recommendation.
%This results in the \emph{cold songs} setting,
%where we recommend a set of newly released songs to extend users' existing playlists. %from users.
%
Lastly, we investigate the problem of recommending newly released songs (\ie \emph{cold songs}) to extend users' existing playlists. 
We find that songs in a playlist are especially helpful in guiding the process of adding new songs to a given playlist.
%We call this setting \emph{cold songs}.



% The challenge of this task, besides those brought by cold-start settings, is two-fold:
% \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
%	\item \emph{Sparsity}. While a large number of playlists are hosted by music streaming services,
% playlists for each user is still limited. This is exacerbated by the long-tailed distribution that
% most users only have a few playlists, while a small portion of users have a very large number of playlists.
% Similarly, a small number of popular songs appeared in a large number of playlists, and the majority of songs
% only appear in a few playlists~\cite{bonnin2013evaluating}.
%	\item \emph{Noise}. There could be noise in metadata~\cite{bonnin2015automated} or users might randomly choose songs 
% from their music collection when composing playlists~\cite{mcfee2012hypergraph}.
%% which makes it hard to learn the intent of a playlist.
% \end{enumerate}
%These challenges make it hard to make recommendations better than simply ranking songs according to their 
% popularity~\cite{mcfee2012million,bonnin2013evaluating,bonnin2015automated},



%%In this paper, we propose a novel approach which ranks 
% In this paper, we propose a novel multitask learning method for playlist recommendation in cold-start settings.

It learns to rank songs that are likely to be in a playlist %that could end up being in a playlist %for the given user 
above those unlikely to be chosen. %by minimising a bipartite ranking loss.
%
%To learn the parameters, 
We optimise the multitask learning objective by formulating %solving 
%which involves 
a constrained convex optimisation problem.
To avoid dealing with an enormous number of constraints,
we approximate an optimal solution %of the multitask learning objective
by minimising an unconstrained objective 
inspired by an equivalence %relationship 
between bipartite ranking and binary classification.
