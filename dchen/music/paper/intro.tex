\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Online music streaming services (\eg Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, Google Play Music, Amazon Music etc.) 
are playing an increasingly important role in the digital music industry.
A key ingredient is the ability to automatically continue playlists 
to create an uninterrupted listening experience and help user explore a large collection of music.

% brief description of both recommendation tasks
We are motivated by the problem of automatically augmenting (continuing?) music playlist with a collection of songs $\SCal$,
in particular, given a partial playlist with the first $K$ songs\footnote{$K$ can be different for different partial playlists.},
we would like to recommend a subset of $\SCal$ by learning from user created playlist dataset.
This task is also known as Automatic Playlist Continuation~\cite{schedl2017,recsysch2018}.
