{\it
%Binary classification and bipartite ranking are the simplest form among their own kind, during the decades (or even tens of decades) of research,
%quite a few loss functions have been proposed for these two tasks. 
%Yet, the relationships between these losses are not fully clear.

%There are many works that explored this topic, 
%JMLR'11 and JMLR'16 are typically ones,
%JMLR'11 showed that P-Norm push loss and P-Classification loss enjoys a nice equivalence relationships under exponential surrogate,
%moreover, the RankBoost and AdaBoost ...

%JMLR'16 showed that four of ... losses are equivalent. 

Briefly describe bipartite ranking, binary classification, multi-label classification.
the equivalence between P-Classification loss and P-Norm push loss under exponential surrogate.

top-push vs. bottom push, top-push vs P-Classification vs p-norm.
