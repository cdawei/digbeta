Online music streaming services (\eg Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, Google Play Music, Amazon Music etc.) 
are playing an increasingly important role in the digital music industry.

to create an uninterrupted listening experience and help user explore a large collection of music.

% explain what is different about recommending playlist

% brief description of both recommendation tasks
We are motivated by the problem of automatically generate music playlists for given a user,
whom can either be known/familiar by the system, which the system can make use of the user's previous playlists (listening history?)
to hopefully make high quality recommendation, or can be new user, which means the system has to make use of playlists of other users
to make a decent default recommendation.

There is a rich collection of works that related to the task of recommending music for playlist.

%This task is also known as Automatic Playlist Continuation~\cite{schedl2017,recsysch2018}.
