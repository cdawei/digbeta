\section{Conclusion and future work}

We investigate the problem of recommending playlists to users in cold-start settings.
In the {\it cold songs} setting, we recommend newly released songs to extend existing playlists;
in the {\it cold playlists} setting, we recommend a set of songs to form a new playlist for an existing user;
and in the {\it cold users} setting, we recommend a set of songs to form a playlist for a new user.
We deal with all three cold-start settings using a multitask learning method which encourages songs in playlist 
to be ranked higher than those are not by minimising a bipartite ranking loss. 
We formulate the multitask objective as a constrained convex optimisation problem, and further approximates it 
by an unconstrained objective inspired by an equivalence relationship between bipartite ranking and binary classification. 
Empirical results on two real music playlist datasets show the proposed approach 
has good performance for playlist recommendation in cold-start settings.

%We are aware of the limitations of our proposed approach, 
% Our proposed approach has a few limitations,
% which we leave as future work.
% In particular, 
For future work, we would like to explore 
auxiliary data sources (\eg music information shared on social media) and additional song/user 
features (\eg lyrics, user profile), % as well as the sequential order of songs in playlist %which could 
%provide additional information to 
which could potentially help make better recommendations.
Further, non-linear models such as deep neural networks have been shown to work extremely well in a wide arrange of tasks,
and the linear model with sparse parameters in this work is likely to be more compact if non-linear objective were adopted.

% Finally, as a remark, we want to mention the challenge of evaluating the recommended results.
% While metrics in information retrieval are commonly employed, recommender system is more like a generative process
% than a information retrieval task. Fortunately, this challenge has been noticed and been attacked in a number of
% ways~\cite{mcfee2011natural,mcfee2012hypergraph,schedl2017}, 
% we believe that promising automatic evaluation methods that accepted by the (majority of) 
% community is one premise of significant progress in music recommendation.
