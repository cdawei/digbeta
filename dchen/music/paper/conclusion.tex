\section{Conclusion and future work}

We study the problem of recommending playlists to users in three cold-start settings:
cold playlists, cold users and cold songs.
We propose a multitask learning method that learns user- and playlist-specific weights 
as well as shared weights from user-curated playlists,
which allows us to form new personalised playlists for an existing user, %in the cold playlists setting,
produce playlists for a new user, %in the cold users setting, 
and extend users' playlists with newly released songs. %in the cold songs setting.
We optimise the parameters (\ie weights) %of the multitask learning method 
by minimising a bipartite ranking loss
that encourages songs in a playlist to be ranked higher than those that are not.
%and 
An equivalence between bipartite ranking and binary classification further enables efficient 
approximation of optimal parameters.
Empirical evaluations on two real playlist datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method 
%in recommending playlists in cold-start settings
for cold-start playlist recommendation.

%We investigate the problem of recommending playlists to users in cold-start settings.
%In the {\it cold songs} setting, we recommend newly released songs to extend existing playlists;
%in the {\it cold playlists} setting, we recommend a set of songs to form a new playlist for an existing user;
%and in the {\it cold users} setting, we recommend a set of songs to form a playlist for a new user.
%We deal with all three cold-start settings using a multitask learning method which encourages songs in playlist 
%to be ranked higher than those are not by minimising a bipartite ranking loss. 
%We formulate the multitask objective as a constrained convex optimisation problem, and further approximates it 
%by an unconstrained objective inspired by an equivalence relationship between bipartite ranking and binary classification. 
%Empirical results on two real music playlist datasets show the proposed approach 
%has good performance for playlist recommendation in cold-start settings.
%
%We are aware of the limitations of our proposed approach, 
% Our proposed approach has a few limitations,
% which we leave as future work.
% In particular, 
For future work, we would like to explore 
auxiliary data sources (\eg music information shared on social media) and additional features of songs and users 
(\eg lyrics, user profiles) % as well as the sequential order of songs in playlist %which could 
to make better recommendations.
%provide additional information to 
%which could potentially help make better recommendations
%which might help make better recommendations.
Further, non-linear models such as deep neural networks have been shown to work extremely well in a wide range of tasks,
and the proposed linear model with sparse parameters %in this work 
%would likely 
could be more compact if a non-linear model %objective 
were adopted.

% Finally, as a remark, we want to mention the challenge of evaluating the recommended results.
% While metrics in information retrieval are commonly employed, recommender system is more like a generative process
% than a information retrieval task. Fortunately, this challenge has been noticed and been attacked in a number of
% ways~\cite{mcfee2011natural,mcfee2012hypergraph,schedl2017}, 
% we believe that promising automatic evaluation methods that accepted by the (majority of) 
% community is one premise of significant progress in music recommendation.
