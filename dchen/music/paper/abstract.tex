%Playlists are a core feature of music streaming services.
Playlist recommendation concerns producing a sequence of songs that a user might enjoy.
We investigate this problem in three different cold-start scenarios:
%Specifically, we investigate three settings with different cold items:
(i) \emph{cold songs}, where we recommend newly released songs to extend existing playlists;
(ii) \emph{cold playlists}, where we recommend a set of songs to form a new playlist for an existing user; %without additional context except the user;
(iii) \emph{cold users}, where we recommend a set of songs to form a new playlist for a new user. %, without any other context.

We propose a flexible multitask learning method to deal with all three settings.
The method learns from user-curated playlists,
%the %multitask learning
%method
and encourages songs in the playlist 
to be ranked higher than those are not
by minimising a %the Bottom-Push
bipartite ranking loss.
We formulate the objective as a constrained convex optimisation problem,
and show how this may be approximated by an unconstrained objective
%then address the difficulty of a large number of constraints by approximating the %Bottom-Push loss
%bipartite ranking loss
%with a classification loss
inspired by an equivalence relationship between bipartite ranking and binary classification.
Empirical results on two real music playlist datasets show the proposed approach has good performance for playlist recommendation
in cold-start settings.
