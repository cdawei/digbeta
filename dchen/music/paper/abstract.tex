%Playlists are a core feature of music streaming services.
We investigate the problem of music recommendation in cold-start circumstance.
In particular, we investigate three settings with different cold items:
(i) cold songs, where we recommend newly released songs to extend existing playlists;
(ii) cold playlists, where we recommend a set of songs to form a playlist without additional context except the user;
(iii) cold users, where we recommend a set of songs to form a playlist for a new user, without any other context.
We propose a multitask learning method which is flexible enough to deal with all three settings.
By learning from user curated playlists, the multitask learning method encourages songs in playlist 
ranked higher than those are not by minimising the Bottom-Push bipartite ranking loss.
We formulate a constrained convex optimisation problem to learn the multitask objective,
then address the difficulty of a large number of constraints by approximating the Bottom-Push loss
with a classification loss inspired by an equivalence relationship between bipartite ranking and binary classification.
Empirical results on two real music playlist datasets show the proposed approach has good performance for recommending music 
in cold-start settings.
