Playlists have been a crucial feature of music streaming services.
We investigate the problem of recommending songs to form a playlist for a user.
A multitask learning objective is proposed to make a decent recommendation for a new user.
Playlists of the given user will be used to achieve better recommendation for an existing user.
To learn the parameters, we require that songs could end up being in playlist are ranked above those unlikely.
We further improve the learning efficiency of the ranking approach by transforming its
constrained convex objective into an unconstrained one,
by utilising an equivalence relationship between bipartite ranking and binary classification.
Empirical results on two real music playlist datasets show that the effectiveness of proposed approaches,
and its classification counterpart can be trained more efficiently while maintaining the same level of high performance.
