%Playlists are a core feature of music streaming services.
%Playlist recommendation concerns producing a sequence of songs that a user might enjoy.
Playlist recommendation involves producing a set of songs that a user might enjoy.
We investigate this problem in three %different 
cold-start scenarios:
%Specifically, we investigate three settings with different cold items:
(i) \emph{cold playlists}, 
%where we recommend a set of songs to form a new playlist for an existing user; 
%without additional context except the user;
where we recommend songs to form new personalised playlists for an existing user;
(ii) \emph{cold users},
%where we recommend a set of songs to form a new playlist for a new user; %, without any other context.
where we recommend songs to form new playlists for a new user; and
(iii) \emph{cold songs}, where we recommend newly released songs to extend users' existing playlists.
%
We propose a flexible multitask learning method to deal with all three settings.
The method learns from user-curated playlists,
%the %multitask learning
%method
and encourages songs in a playlist 
to be ranked higher than those that are not
by minimising a %the Bottom-Push
bipartite ranking loss.
Inspired by an equivalence between bipartite ranking and binary classification,
we show how one can efficiently approximate an optimal solution of the multitask learning objective by 
minimising a classification loss.

%We formulate the objective as a constrained convex optimisation problem,
%and show how an optimal solution can be approximated by minimising an unconstrained objective
%inspired by an equivalence %relationship 
%between bipartite ranking and binary classification.
Empirical results on two real playlist datasets show the proposed approach has good performance 
for cold-start playlist recommendation.
%for playlist recommendation in cold-start settings.

%%and show how this may be approximated by an unconstrained objective
%then address the difficulty of a large number of constraints by approximating the %Bottom-Push loss
%bipartite ranking loss
%with a classification loss
%in three cold-start settings.
