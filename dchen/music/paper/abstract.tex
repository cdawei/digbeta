Playlists have been a crucial feature of music streaming services.
We investigate the problem of recommending songs to playlist for
a user that has created a number of playlists when using the service,
or is completely new to the system.
We propose a ranking based approach which ranks songs that could end up being in playlist 
above those unlikely.
We further improve the learning efficiency of the ranking approach by transforming its
constrained convex objective into an unconstrained optimisation problem,
by utilising an equivalence relationship between a bipartite ranking loss 
and its corresponding classification loss.
Empirical results on two real music playlist datasets show that the proposed approach
works effectively, and its classification counterpart can be trained more efficiently
while maintaining the same level of high performance.
