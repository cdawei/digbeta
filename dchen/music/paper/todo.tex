\begin{itemize}
\item Title placeholder: Playlist recommendation and augmentation using multi-label ranking \DONE

\item Loss types: 
      \begin{itemize}
      \item rename:  row-wise $\to$ example, column-wise $\to$ label, row+column $\to$ ? (example + label, both)
      \item explain: why example + label $\ne$ example or label loss
      \item Rename the python variables corresponding to those losses \DONE
      \end{itemize}
\item Explain multi-task regulariser:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item why the name ``multi-task reulariser"? \\
            recommending/augmenting each playlist is considered a task
      \item why it will improve performance
      \end{itemize}
\item Multi-label dataset, \ie bibtex and bookmarks:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Add evaluation metric for rank: \eg P@K
      \item Add results of two more methods: with label loss, with example + label loss (currently method with example loss)
      \item One more method: using multi-task regulariser?
      \item Conclusion: example loss is the best?
      \end{itemize}

\item Connect equations/theory to playlist tasks (new song recommendation, playlist augmentation)

\item New song recommendation:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item explain what is new song recommendation
      \item methods to compare with: independent logistic regression, proposed method using example/label/both losses, 
            the best of (example/label/both) + multi-task regulariser, 
            the best of (example/label/both) + multi-task regulariser with user specific regularisation parameter
      \item a better name (than ``new song recommendation") for this task?
      \end{itemize}

\item Playlist augmentation:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item explain what is playlist augmentation
      \item methods to compare with: the same as (new song recommendation), with new baselines (matrix factorisation, popularity based ranking)
      \end{itemize}

\item Multi-task regulariser with user specific regularisation parameter
      \begin{itemize}
      \item use the AUC score of (best of example/label/both + multi-task regulariser), 
            produce a scatter plot: AUC (y axis) vs. users' \#playlist or (average cosine distance between playlists of the same user) (x axis),
            each point in the scatter plot represents a user
      \item if the scatter plot has a trend such as rising first then dropping down, 
            then multi-task regulariser with user specific regularisation parameter will probably help
      \end{itemize}

\item Experiment on AotM-2011 and 30music dataset for both tasks (new song recommendation, playlist augmentation)

\item Refactor code 
      \begin{itemize}
      \item no large piece of shared code in notebooks
      \item refactor shared code into python packages so that flake8 won't complain that some imports are not at the top
      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
