\subsection{Music recommendation as bipartite ranking}

We can formulate the playlist augmentation problem as bipartite ranking problems, 
and we want to learn a scorer $f$ such that, for a given playlist, 
songs in this playlist will be scored higher than those not in the given playlist,
which is known as the Top-Push loss~\cite{li2014top}
\begin{equation*}
\LCal_\textsc{tp} = \llb f_(u(i), i, m) \ge \max_{n: y_n^i=0} f(u(i), i, n), \ \forall m, y_m^i = 1.
\end{equation*}

The empirical risk is
$$
\RCal_\textsc{rank} 
= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{M_+^i} \sum_{m: y_m^i = 1} \ell \left( f(u(i), i, m) - \max_{n: y_n^i = 0} f(u(i), i, n) \right).
$$

The optimisation problem of this formulation is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:unconsopt}
\begin{aligned}
&\min_{\V, \W, \mubm} \ \RCal_\textsc{rank} + R(\V, \W, \mubm).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
