\paragraph{New song recommendation}

We formulate the task of new song recommendation as either a \emph{classification} or \emph{bipartite ranking} problem ({\it multitask?}),
where we predict, for each song in test set,
whether it will be included in a given playlist.
This formulation is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:mlr},
where rows represent songs (from top to bottom, sorted by the release date in ascending order)
and columns represent playlists (no specific order).
Further, rows with white colour represent songs in training set, and rows with grey colour represent songs in test set.
If entry $(i, j)$ is \texttt{1} (or \texttt{0}), it means the $i$-th song is (or not) found in the $j$-th playlist,
otherwise, we do not know whether the $i$-th song is found in the $j$-th playlist (\ie entry $(i, j)$ is a question mark \texttt{?}).
As a remark, we do not care about the order of songs in a playlist.
