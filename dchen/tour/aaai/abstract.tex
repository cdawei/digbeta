Current recommender systems largely focus on static, unstructured content;
however, in many scenarios, we would like to recommend content having sequential structure.
For example, in \emph{trajectory recommendation}, we wish to recommend to travellers a sequence of points-of-interest in a city.
Our predictions must thus have global cohesion, while also omitting repeated items.
In this paper, we address trajectory recommendation via an extension of the structured support vector machine (SSVM).
While a vanilla application of SSVMs is hampered by the existence of multiple ground truths for a query,
we show how a modification of the training objective and loss-augmented inference can account for this.
Experiments on real-world trajectory datasets show the benefits of our approach over existing, non-structured approaches.

%this problem
%differs from the typical structured prediction problem
%in that there are multiple correct answers for a given input.
%Motivated by trajectory recommendation, we focus on sequential structures
%but in contrast to classical Viterbi decoding we require that
%valid predictions are sequences with no repeated elements.

%For prediction, we modify the inference procedure to avoid predicting loops in the sequence.
%For training, we modify the objective function to account for the existence of multiple ground truths for a given input. We also modify the loss-augmented inference procedure to exclude the known ground truths.
