Current recommender systems largely focus on static, unstructured content.
In many scenarios, we would like to recommend content that is a path,
such as a trajectory of points-of-interest in a city.

%Dubbed {\em Structured Recommendation},
%This sequence recommendation problem
%this problem
%differs from the typical structured prediction problem
%in that there are multiple correct answers for a given input.
%Motivated by trajectory recommendation, we focus on sequential structures
%but in contrast to classical Viterbi decoding we require that
%valid predictions are sequences with no repeated elements.
We require that trajectories are a sequence of items that are globally cohesive, but
do not have repeated items. We propose a modification of sequence prediction
that enables trajectory recommendation.

We introduce an approach to learn from session data based on the structured support vector machine.
%For prediction, we modify the inference procedure to avoid predicting loops in the sequence.
%For training, we modify the objective function to account for the existence of multiple ground truths for a given input. We also modify the loss-augmented inference procedure to exclude the known ground truths.
%Experiments on real-world trajectory recommendation datasets show the benefits of our approach over existing, non-structured recommendation approaches.
We modify the objective function and loss-augmented inference to account for the existence of multiple ground truths for a given seed item.
Experiments on real-world trajectory datasets show the benefits of our approach over existing, non-structured recommendation approaches.
