We cast the problem of {\trajrec}
as a structured prediction problem.
Our solution extends structured SVMs to account for two challenges:
(1) the existence of multiple ground truths;
(2) avoiding predicting loops in the sequence.
The inference procedures are novel applications of the list Viterbi algorithm.
Experiments on real-world trajectory recommendation datasets showed that
structured recommendation outperform existing, non-structured approaches.

Our viewpoint enables researchers to bring recent advances in structured prediction
to bear on {\trajrec} problems,
including further improving the efficiency of inference and learning.
In the other direction, techniques from recommender systems to capture latent
user- and POI-representations, in sufficiently rich domains, may
improve the predictive power of structured prediction models.
