We cast the problem of sequence recommendation
as a structured prediction problem.
Our proposed solution extends structured SVMs to account for the new setting:
first, we modified the training objective to account for the existence of multiple ground truths;
second, we modified the prediction and loss augmented inference procedures to avoid predicting
loops in the sequence. The inference procedures are novel applications of the list Viterbi
algorithm.
Experiments on real-world trajectory recommendation datasets showed that
structured recommendation outperform existing, non-structured approaches.
Our new viewpoint enables researchers to bring recent advances in structured prediction
to bear on recommender systems problems,
including further improving the efficiency of inference and learning.
In the other direction techniques from recommender systems to capture latent
user- and POI-representations, in sufficiently rich domains, may be used to
improve the predictive power of structured prediction models.
