%\subsection{Structured and {\seqrec}}
%\label{sec:seqrec-defn}

%\subsection{The {\seqrec} problem}
%\subsection{Problem formulation}
\subsection{The sequence recommendation problem}

%We now generalise the previous discussion to cover a broad class of problems.
%Consider the following %general %abstract
%\emph{{\seqrec}} problem:
Consider the following abstract problem:
given an input query $\x \in \mathcal{X}$ (\eg representing an initial location),
we wish to recommend one or more \emph{structured outputs} $\y \in \mathcal{Y}$ (\eg representing a sequence of locations)
according to a learned \emph{score function} $f(\x,\y)$.
To learn $f$,
we have as input a training set
%$(\x\pb{i}, \{ \y\pb{ij} \}_{j=1:n^i})$, $i=1:n$,
$\{ ( \x\pb{i}, \{ \y\pb{ij} \}_{j=1}^{n_i} ) \}_{i=1}^{n}$,
comprising a set %collection
of inputs $\x\pb{i}$ with an associated \emph{set} of $n_i$ output structures $\{ \y\pb{ij} \}_{j=1}^{n_i}$.

For this work, we assume the output $\y$ is a \emph{sequence} of $l$ points, denoted $y_{1:l}$
where each $y_i$ belongs to some fixed set (\eg points-of-interest in a city).
%For example, each $\y$ may be a sequences of places in a city, or a playlist of songs.
%Thus, for example, the training set might represent a collection of users in a city, along with a set of trajectories () they have visited.
We call the resulting specialisation the \emph{{\seqrec}} problem.
%and this shall be our primary interest in this paper.
In many settings, one further requires the sequences to be \emph{paths}~\cite{west2001introduction}, \ie not contain any repetitions.

%As a remark, we note that the assumption that $\y$ is a sequence does not limit the generality of our approach,
%as inferring $\y$ of other structures can be achieved using corresponding inference and loss-augmented inference algorithms~\cite{joachims2009predicting}.  %LX - this sentence can be cut or merged above




\subsection{Special case: {\trajrec}}

%{\trajrec} involve a set of points-of-interest (POIs) $\mathcal{P}$
Suppose we have a set of points-of-interest (POIs) $\mathcal{P}$ in a city.
A \emph{trajectory} is a sequence of POIs.
The \emph{\trajrec} problem~\cite{bao2015recommendations,zheng2015trajectory} is:
%The \emph{\trajrec} problem is:
given a \emph{trajectory query} $\mathbf{x} = (s, l)$,
comprising a start POI $s \in \mathcal{P}$ and trip length
%\footnote{Instead of specifying the number of desired POIs,
%we can constrain the trajectory with a total time budget $T$.
%In this case, the number of POIs $l$ can be treated as a \emph{hidden} variable,
%with additional constraint $\sum_{k=1}^l t_k \le T$ where $t_k$ is the time spent at POI $y_k$.}
$l \!>\! 1$ (\ie the desired number of POIs, including $s$),
recommend one or more trajectories  %%(or \emph{trajectories}) %$\mathbf{y}^*$
%that maximise some notion of utility,
%To learn a suitable $f$,
%we are
%provided as input
%learned from %a training set
by a model learned from
historical
%$(\x\pb{i}, \{ \y\pb{ij} \}_{j=1:n^i})$, $i=1:n$,
%comprising pairs of queries and corresponding
%of
trajectories visited by travellers.

The {\trajrec} problem can be seen as a special case of {\seqrec}:
given {\trajectory} query $\x$, and a suitable scoring function $f$, we wish to find
$\mathbf{y}^* = \argmax_{\mathbf{y} \in \mathcal{Y}}~f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}),$
%%DW: use top-k prediction formulation or not?
where $\mathcal{Y}$ is the set of all possible trajectories with POIs in $\mathcal{P}$ that conform to the constraints imposed by the query $\mathbf{x}$.
In particular,
$\mathbf{y} = (s,~ y_2, \dots, y_l)$ is a {\trajectory} with $l$ POIs. %, which has no sub-tours. %i.e. $y_j \ne y_k$ if $j \ne k$.
This was the view proposed in~\cite{cikm16paper}, where the authors considered an
objective that combined a POI and transition score.

Now, our training set of historical trajectories may be written as
$\{ ( \x\pb{i}, \{ \y\pb{ij} \}_{j=1}^{n_i} ) \}_{i=1}^{n}$,
where each $\x\pb{i}$ is a distinct query
with $\{ \y\pb{ij} \}_{j=1}^{n_i}$ the corresponding \emph{set} of observed trajectories.
%Note that
We expect most queries to have several distinct trajectories;
minimally,
for example,
there may be two nearby POIs that are visited in interchangeable order by different travellers.
We are also interested in predicting \emph{paths}, % $\y$,
since it is unlikely a user will want to visit the same location twice.

\subsection{Challenges of {\trajrec}}

Trajectory recommendation bears some resemblance to established problems. %related to recommendation and sequences.
For example, 
consider a typical recommender systems problem
with non-structured, {static} content such as books or movies~\citep{Goldberg:1992,Sarwar:2001,Netflix}.
Here, if $x$ represents the identity of a user and $y$ the identity of an item,
one also learns a score function $f( x, y )$, \eg via matrix factorisation~\citep{Koren:2009},
and makes a prediction by enumerating all ({non-structured}) items $y$ to compute $\argmax_y f(x,y)$.

Another similarity is to structured prediction.
Here, we wish to predict some structured label $\y \in \mathcal{Y}$ for an input $\x \in \mathcal{X}$,
typically via a score function $f(\x,\y)$ that determines the affinity of an (input, label) pair.
In a structured prediction problem for sequences, the goal is to learn from a set of input vector and output sequence tuples
$\{ (\x\pb{i}, \y\pb{i}) \}_{i = 1}^n$, where
for each input $\x\pb{i}$ there is one \emph{unique} output sequence $\y\pb{i}$.

\end{table}

%There are key differences between {\seqrec} and %what is being solved in
% Compared to
% standard problems in recommender systems and structured prediction,
Despite these apparent similarities,
there are three unique challenges to trajectory recommendation.
%in both inference and learning.


\subsubsection{Global cohesion}
%Each of the {\seqrec} problems above
Trajectory recommendation can be plausibly solved with approaches that do not exploit the structure inherent in the outputs. % $\y$. %% or do so in a simple way.
While such approaches can certainly be useful,
their modelling power is inherently limited,
as
they cannot ensure the \emph{global} cohesion of the corresponding recommendations. % $\y$.
%as they inherently rely on either pointwise or pairwise preferences for POIs.
For example, %in the {\trajrec} problem,
a ranking based approach %the RankSVM model %as argued in Section~\ref{sec:intro},
might find three restaurants to be the highest scoring POIs;
however, it is unlikely that most travellers will enjoy this. %these form a {\trajectory} that .
% This motivates an approach %to {\seqrec}
% that directly ensures such global cohesion.

We remark also that one cannot na\"{i}vely 
compute $\argmax_\y f(\x,\y)$
as in typical recommender systems,
since 
%For {\seqrec},
it is often impossible to efficiently enumerate $\y$ (\ie all possible trajectories in a city).
This inability to enumerate $\y$ also poses a challenge in designing a suitable $f(\x,\y)$,
\eg
%the standard matrix factorisation approach to recommender systems~\citep{Koren:2009}
matrix factorisation
would require associating a latent feature with each $\y$, which will be infeasible.




\subsubsection{Multiple ground truths}
%In a structured prediction problem (for sequences), the goal is to learn from a set of
%input vector and output sequence tuples
%$\{ (\x\pb{i}, \y\pb{i}) \}_{i = 1}^n$, where
%for each input $\x\pb{i}$ there is usually one \emph{unique} output sequence $\y\pb{i}$.
%In a {\seqrec} problem, %however,
%we expect that %learn from
%for each input $\x\pb{i}$ (\eg users),
%there are \emph{multiple} associated outputs
%$\{ \y\pb{ij} \}_{j=1}^{n_i}$ (\eg trajectories visited).
%Structured prediction approaches do not have a standard way to handle such multiple output sequences.
%
Recall that in a typical structured prediction problem,
there is usually one \emph{unique} output for each input.
However, in trajectory recommendation,
we expect that for each input $\x\pb{i}$, % (\eg users),
there are \emph{multiple} associated outputs
$\{ \y\pb{ij} \}_{j=1}^{n_i}$ (\ie trajectories visited).
Structured prediction approaches do not have a standard way to handle such multiple output sequences.


\subsubsection{Loop elimination}
In trajectory recommendation, it is desirable for the recommended sequence to consist of unique elements,
or be a {\em path} in the candidate space (\eg locations).
Classic structured prediction does not constrain the output sequence, and having such a
path constraint makes both inference and learning harder.


Table \ref{tbl:challenges} summarises the three main challenges of sequence recommendation.
In the next section, we will see how to deal with the global cohesion and multiple ground truths with a novel extension of
%a classic structured prediction model,
the structured support vector machine,
and solve the loop elimination problem with the list Viterbi algorithm and integer linear programming (ILP).
