We introduce the {\seqrec} problem that is the focus of this paper,
by first providing an abstract mathematical formulation, 
then cast trajectory recommendation as a special case,
and finally, we summarise the main challenges brought by sequence recommendation.
%We then provide some motivating examples, in particular the problem of {\trajrec}.

%\subsection{Structured and {\seqrec}}
%\label{sec:seqrec-defn}

%\subsection{The {\seqrec} problem}
\subsection{Problem formulation}

%We now generalise the previous discussion to cover a broad class of problems.
%Consider the following %general %abstract
%\emph{{\seqrec}} problem:
Given an input query $\x \in \mathcal{X}$ (representing \eg a location, or some ``seed'' song),
we wish to recommend one or more \emph{structured outputs} $\y \in \mathcal{Y}$ (representing \eg a sequence of locations, or songs)
according to a learned \emph{score function} $f(\x,\y)$.
To learn $f$,
we are provided as input a training set
%$(\x\pb{i}, \{ \y\pb{ij} \}_{j=1:n^i})$, $i=1:n$,
$\{ ( \x\pb{i}, \{ \y\pb{ij} \}_{j=1}^{n_i} ) \}_{i=1}^{n}$,
comprising a set %collection 
of inputs $\x\pb{i}$ with an associated \emph{set} of $n_i$ output structures $\{ \y\pb{ij} \}_{j=1}^{n_i}$.

For this work, we assume the output $\y$ is a \emph{sequence} of $l$ points, denoted $y_{1:l}$
where each $y_i$ belongs to some fixed set (\eg places of interest in a city, or a collection of songs).
%For example, each $\y$ may be a sequences of places in a city, or a playlist of songs.
%Thus, for example, the training set might represent a collection of users in a city, along with a set of trajectories () they have visited.
We call the resulting specialisation the \emph{{\seqrec}} problem,
and this shall be our primary interest in this paper.
In many settings, one further requires the sequences to be \emph{paths}~\cite{west2001introduction}, \ie not contain any repetitions.

%As a remark, we note that the assumption that $\y$ is a sequence does not limit the generality of our approach,
%as inferring $\y$ of other structures can be achieved using corresponding inference and loss-augmented inference algorithms~\cite{joachims2009predicting}.  %LX - this sentence can be cut or merged above

\subsection{Contrast to recommender systems}

%
%\subsubsection{Recommender systems}
In a typical recommender systems problem, the outputs are non-structured; canonically, one works with {static} content such as books or movies~\citep{Goldberg:1992,Sarwar:2001,Netflix}.
Thus, making a prediction involves enumerating all {\em non-structured} items $y$ in order to compute $\argmax_y f(\x,y)$ for suitable score function $f$, \eg some form of matrix factorisation~\citep{Koren:2009}.
For {\seqrec}, computing $\argmax_\y f(\x,\y)$ is harder since it is often impossible to efficiently enumerate $\y$ (\eg all possible trajectories in a city).
This inability to enumerate $\y$ also poses a challenge in designing a suitable $f(\x,\y)$,
\eg
%the standard matrix factorisation approach to recommender systems~\citep{Koren:2009}
matrix factorisation
would require associating a latent feature with each $\y$, which will be infeasible.



%
\subsection{Special case: {\trajrec}}

{\trajrec} involve a set of points-of-interest (POIs) $\mathcal{P}$ 
in a city~\cite{bao2015recommendations,zheng2015trajectory,zheng2014urban}.
%The \emph{\trajrec} problem is:
Given a \emph{trajectory query} $\mathbf{x} = (s, l)$,
comprising a start POI $s \in \mathcal{P}$ and trip length
%\footnote{Instead of specifying the number of desired POIs,
%we can constrain the trajectory with a total time budget $T$.
%In this case, the number of POIs $l$ can be treated as a \emph{hidden} variable,
%with additional constraint $\sum_{k=1}^l t_k \le T$ where $t_k$ is the time spent at POI $y_k$.}
$l \!>\! 1$ (\ie the desired number of POIs, including $s$),
the \emph{\trajrec} problem is to
recommend one or more sequences of POIs %%(or \emph{trajectories}) %$\mathbf{y}^*$
that maximise some notion of utility,
%To learn a suitable $f$,
%we are
%provided as input
learned from a training set
%$(\x\pb{i}, \{ \y\pb{ij} \}_{j=1:n^i})$, $i=1:n$,
%comprising pairs of queries and corresponding
of trajectories visited by travellers in the city.

We can view the {\trajrec} problem as {\seqrec} in the following way:
given {\trajectory} query $\x$, and a suitable scoring function $f$, we wish to find
$\mathbf{y}^* = \argmax_{\mathbf{y} \in \mathcal{Y}}~f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}),$
%%DW: use top-k prediction formulation or not?
where $\mathcal{Y}$ is the set of all possible trajectories with POIs in $\mathcal{P}$ that conform to the constraints imposed by the query $\mathbf{x}$.
In particular,
$\mathbf{y} = (s,~ y_2, \dots, y_l)$ is a {\trajectory} with $l$ POIs. %, which has no sub-tours. %i.e. $y_j \ne y_k$ if $j \ne k$.
This was the view proposed in~\cite{cikm16paper} where the authors considered an
objective function that added two components together: a POI score and a transition score.

Now, our training set of historical trajectories may be written as
$\{ ( \x\pb{i}, \{ \y\pb{ij} \}_{j=1}^{n_i} ) \}_{i=1}^{n}$,
where each $\x\pb{i}$ is a distinct query
with $\{ \y\pb{ij} \}_{j=1}^{n_i}$ the corresponding \emph{set} of observed trajectories.
%Note that 
We expect most queries to have several distinct trajectories;
minimally,
for example,
there may be two nearby POIs that are visited in interchangeable order by different travellers.
We are also interested in predicting \emph{paths}, % $\y$, 
since it is unlikely a user will want to visit the same location twice.

%\subsection{{\seqrec} versus existing problems}
%\subsection{Comparison to existing problems}
\subsection{Challenges of {\seqrec}}

There are key differences between {\seqrec} and %what is being solved in
standard problems in recommender systems and structured prediction;
this brings unique challenges for both inference and learning.

%
\subsubsection{Global cohesion}
%Each of the {\seqrec} problems above 
The {\seqrec} problem can be plausibly solved with approaches that do not exploit the structure inherent in the outputs. % $\y$. %% or do so in a simple way.
While such approaches can certainly be useful,
their modelling power is inherently limited,
as
they cannot ensure the \emph{global} cohesion of the corresponding recommendations. % $\y$.
%as they inherently rely on either pointwise or pairwise preferences for POIs.
For example, in the {\trajrec} problem, a ranking based approach %the RankSVM model %as argued in Section~\ref{sec:intro},
might find three restaurants to be the highest scoring POIs;
however, it is unlikely that these form a {\trajectory} that most travellers will enjoy.
This motivates an approach to {\seqrec} that directly ensures such global cohesion.


%
\subsubsection{Multiple ground truths}
In a structured prediction problem (for sequences), the goal is to learn from a set of
input vector and output sequence tuples
$\{ (\x\pb{i}, \y\pb{i}) \}_{i = 1}^n$, where
for each input $\x\pb{i}$ there is usually one \emph{unique} output sequence $\y\pb{i}$.
In a {\seqrec} problem, however, we expect that %learn from
for each input $\x\pb{i}$ (\eg users),
there are \emph{multiple} associated outputs
$\{ \y\pb{ij} \}_{j=1}^{n_i}$ (\eg trajectories visited).
Structured prediction approaches do not have a standard way to handle such multiple output sequences.


%
\subsubsection{Loop elimination}
Furthermore, in settings such as trajectory recommendation, it is desirable for the recommended sequence to consist of unique elements,
or be a {\em path} in the candidate space (\eg locations).
Classic structured prediction does not constrain the output sequence, and having such a
path constraint makes both inference and learning harder. \\


%\subsection{The case for exploiting structure}

%We now see how to do so with novel extensions to structured prediction approaches. %by attacking the problem using tools from structured prediction.
% TODO: add text that fleshes these out

Table \ref{tbl:challenges} summarises the three main challenges of {\seqrec}.
In the next section, we will see how to deal with the global cohesion and multiple ground truths with a novel extension of 
%a classic structured prediction model, 
the structured support vector machine,
and solve the loop elimination problem with integer linear programming (ILP) or the list Viterbi algorithm.
