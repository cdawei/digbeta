Current recommender systems largely focus on static, unstructured content.
In many scenarios, we would like to recommend content that has sequential structure,
such as %when recommending
a trajectory of points-of-interests in a city, or a playlist of songs.
We propose an approach to sequential recommendation based
on techniques from structured prediction.
Starting from a classic structured support vector machine,
we propose two changes to the method %(originally designed for classification)
enabling us to solve structured recommendation.
First, we modify the training objective to account for the existence of multiple ground truths.
Second, we modify the prediction and loss augmented inference procedures to avoid predicting loops in the sequence via an extension of the Viterbi algorithm.
Experiments on real-world trajectory recommendation datasets show the benefits of our approach over existing, non-structured recommendation approaches.
