We showed how the problem of sequence recommendation
%which arises in contexts such as recommending a playlist of songs, or a trajectory of points-of-interest in a city,
can be viewed as a structured prediction problem.
\rev{We based our solution on a structured SVM, with two important extensions}:
first, we modified the training objective to account for the existence of multiple ground truths;
second, we modified the prediction and loss augmented inference procedures to avoid predicting loops in the sequence via list Viterbi algorithms.
Experiments on real-world trajectory recommendation datasets showed that structure recommendation outperform existing, non-structured approaches. 
\rev{Future work include further improving the efficiency of inference and learning, and extending our approaches to additionally capture latent user- and POI-representations, in a domain where sequential and personal information is sufficiently rich.}

%There are several directions for future work.
%First, it is of interest to assess the viability of probabilistic approaches to structured prediction,
%such as the conditional random field and maximum entropy Markov model.
%Second, extending our approaches to additionally capture latent user- and POI-representations, when sufficient personalised data of this type is available, would be of interest.
%Third, applying structured prediction approaches to other sequential prediction problems, such as playlist generation, may indicate similar benefits as observed in trajectory recommendation.
%Third, it will be beneficial to consider loss-augmented inference for more complex performance measures.
