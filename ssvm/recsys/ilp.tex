We should probably ask Phil Kilby or Hassan about the two or three most popular subtour eliminations

\begin{itemize}
	\item Elementary shortest path problems

	\item Different subtour eliminations
  	\item (Dantzig, Fulkerson, Johnson, 1954) has 3 different versions
  	\item (Miller, Tucker, Zemlin, 1960) has another one.
  	\item Seems to be one more, not sure by whom (maybe Belmore, Malone, 1971)

\end{itemize}
